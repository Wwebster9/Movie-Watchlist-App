# Movie-Watchlist-App

A movie watchlist that uses a PostgreSQL database to store information. This program prompts users with a series of menu options allowing users to add movies to the list, view upcoming movies (based on release date), view the entire list of movies, watch a movie (this will add the movie to a separate table called 'watched'), view the watched movies list, add additional users, and search for specific movies.
